# CryptoWeb

***Credits to JavaScript Mastery for this project***
## Overview

CryptoWeb is a cryptocurrency app which displays shows the stats, exchanges, news, and details of cryptocurrencies around the world. Originally a React and JS app, I converted this to a Next and TS app to practice my TypeScript skills and speed up this app by using Next. The APIs used to fetch the data are Coinranking and Bing News Search.
